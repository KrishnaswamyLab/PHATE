Description: PHATE  - Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Trajectory Embedding
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        PHATE has been implemented in Python3 and Matlab.
        
        #### Installation and dependencies for the Python version
        1. The Python3 version of PHATE can be installed using:
        
                $ git clone git://github.com/SmitaKrishnaswamy/PHATE.git
                $ cd Python
                $ python3 setup.py install --user
        
        2. PHATE depends on a number of `python3` packages available on pypi and these dependencies are listed in `setup.py`
        All the dependencies will be automatically installed using the above commands
        
        ### Usage
        PHATE has been implemented with an API that should be familiar to those with experience using scikit-learn. The core of the PHATE package is the `PHATE` class which is a subclass of `sklearn.base.BaseEstimator`.  To get started, `import phate` and instantiate a `phate.PHATE()` object. Just like most `sklearn` estimators, `PHATE()` objects have both `fit()` and `fit_transform()` methods. For more information, check out our notebook below.
        
        If you want to try running some of our test scripts on a DLA fractal tree:
        1. Make the test scripts executable
        
                $ cd PHATE/Python/test
                $ chmod +x phate_test_tree.py phate_test_mESC.py
                $ ./phate_test_tree.py #output saved in a png
                $ ./phate_test_mESC.py #output opens in a matplotlib window
