Contributing to PHATE
============================

There are many ways to contribute to `PHATE`, with the most common ones
being contribution of code or documentation to the project. Improving the
documentation is no less important than improving the library itself. If you
find a typo in the documentation, or have made improvements, do not hesitate to
submit a GitHub pull request.

But there are many other ways to help. In particular answering queries on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/PHATE/issues),
investigating bugs, and [reviewing other developers' pull
requests](https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/PHATE/pulls)
are very valuable contributions that decrease the burden on the project
maintainers.

Another way to contribute is to report issues you're facing, and give a "thumbs
up" on issues that others reported and that are relevant to you. It also helps
us if you spread the word: reference the project from your blog and articles,
link to it from your website, or simply star it in GitHub to say "I use it".

Code Style and Testing
----------------------

Contributors are encouraged to write tests for their code, but if you do not know how to do so, please do not feel discouraged from contributing code! Others can always help you test your contribution.

Code style is dictated by [`black`](https://pypi.org/project/black/#installation-and-usage). To automatically reformat your code when you run `git commit`, you can run `./autoblack.sh` in the root directory of this project to add a hook to your `git` repository.
